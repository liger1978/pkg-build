# SPLIT MASTER INSTALL

#--------------------------------------------------------------------
# Global Answers
# These answers are always needed.

# Y or N — Whether to install. Answer files must set this to Y.
q_install=y

# Y or N — Whether the installer has permission to install additional packages
# from the OS’s repositories. If this is set to N, the installation will fail
# if the installer detects missing dependencies.
q_vendor_packages_install=y

#--------------------------------------------------------------------
# Components
# These answers are always needed.

# Y or N — Whether to install the puppet master role.
q_puppetmaster_install=y

# Y or N — Whether to install the database support (the console Postgres server
# and PuppetDB) role.
q_puppetdb_install=n

# Y or N — DEPRECATED Whether to install the cloud provisioner role.
# Cloud provisioner will be removed in future versions of PE.
q_puppet_cloud_install=n

#--------------------------------------------------------------------
# Puppet Agent Answers
# These answers are always needed.

# Y or N — This is a silent install option, default is N. When set to "Y", the
# installer will skip master verification which allows the user to deploy agents
# when they know the master won’t be available.
q_skip_master_verification=n

#--------------------------------------------------------------------
# Puppet Master Answers
# These answers are generally needed if you are installing the puppet master
# role.

# Y or N — Whether or not the installation is an all-in-one installation,
# (i.e., are puppetdb and the console also being installed on this node).
q_all_in_one_install=n

# String — An identifying string for the puppet master. This ID must be unique
# across your entire site. The server’s fully qualified domain name is often
# used as the puppet master’s certname.
q_puppetmaster_certname=pe-master.localdomain

# String — Valid DNS names at which the puppet master can be reached. Must be a
# comma-separated list. In a normal installation, defaults to
# <hostname>,<hostname.domain>,puppet,puppet.<domain>.
q_puppetmaster_dnsaltnames=pe-master,pe-master.localdomain

# String — The hostname of the server running the console role. Only needed if
# you are not installing the console role on the puppet master server.
q_puppetmaster_enterpriseconsole_hostname=pe-console.localdomain

# Integer — The port on which to contact the console server. Only needed if you
# are not installing the console role on the puppet master server.
q_puppetmaster_enterpriseconsole_port=443

# y or n; MUST BE LOWERCASE — Whether to check for updates whenever the pe-httpd
# service restarts. To get the correct update info, the server will pass some
# basic, anonymous info to Puppet Labs’ servers. Specifically, it will transmit:
# the IP address of the client
# the type and version of the client’s OS
# the installed version of PE
# the number of nodes licensed and the number of nodes used
# If you wish to disable update checks (e.g. if your company policy forbids
# transmitting this information), you will need to set this to n. You can also
# disable checking after installation by editing the
# /etc/puppetlabs/installer/answers.install file.
q_pe_check_for_updates=y

# String — A publicly accessible hostname where the console can be accessed if
# the host name resolves to a private interface (e.g., Amazon EC2). This is set
# automatically by the installer on EC2 nodes, but can be set manually in
# environments with multiple hostnames.
#q_public_hostname=

# Y or N - Whether to use the Puppet 4 parser or not.
q_enable_future_parser=n

#--------------------------------------------------------------------
# PuppetDB Answers

# String — The hostname of the server running PuppetDB.
q_puppetdb_hostname=pe-puppetdb.localdomain

# Integer — The port where the PuppetDB server can be reached.

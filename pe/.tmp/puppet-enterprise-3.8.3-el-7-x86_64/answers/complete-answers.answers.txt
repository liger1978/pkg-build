# COMPLETE ANSWERS
# This answer file documents every answer which should be manipulated in an answer file.
# This answer file will still generate an ALL IN ONE INSTALL

#--------------------------------------------------------------------
# Global Answers
# These answers are always needed.

# Y or N — Whether to install. Answer files must set this to "Y".
q_install=y

# Y or N — Whether the installer has permission to install additional packages
# from the OS’s repositories. If this is set to N, the installation will fail
# if the installer detects missing dependencies.
q_vendor_packages_install=y

# Y or N — Only used on AIX. Whether to run the updtvpkg command to add info
# about native libraries to the RPM database. The answer should usually be Y,
# unless you have special needs around the RPM database.
# These answers are only used in some cases, such as when upgrading or reinstalling.
#q_run_updtvpkg=y

# Y or N — Whether the installer should backup the existing configuration files
# and then purge them, or leave them in place. If set to N the installer will
# fail. This is only needed if Puppet Enterprise was uninstalled without the -p
# option.
#q_backup_and_purge_old_configuration=y

# Y or N — Only used on Upgrade. Whether upgrading should stop if there is a
# custom auth.conf file. If there is a custom auth.conf file an upgrade could
# fail if the auth.conf file is not migrated properly.  This answer exists to
# provide a way to upgrade after confirming that auth.conf has been migrated.
#q_exit_and_update_auth_conf=y

#--------------------------------------------------------------------
# Components
# These answers are always needed.

# Y or N — Whether to install the puppet master role.
q_puppetmaster_install=y

# Y or N — Whether or not the installation is an all-in-one installation,
# (i.e., are puppetdb and the console also being installed on this node). This
# is also known as a monolithic install.

# Y or N — Whether to install the database support (the console PostgreSQL
# server and PuppetDB) role.
#q_puppetdb_install=y

# Y or N — Whether to install the console role.
#q_puppet_enterpriseconsole_install=y

# Y or N — Whether to install the puppet agent role.
#q_puppetagent_install=y

# Y or N — DEPRECATED Whether to install the cloud provisioner role.
# Cloud provisioner will be removed in future versions of PE.
q_puppet_cloud_install=n

#--------------------------------------------------------------------
# Puppet Agent Answers
# These answers are always needed.

# unique across your entire site. Fully qualified domain names are often used
# as agent certnames.

# Y or N — Whether to quit the install if the puppet master cannot be reached.
#q_fail_on_unsuccessful_master_lookup=y

# installer will skip master verification which allows the user to deploy agents
# when they know the master won’t be available.

# y or n; MUST BE LOWERCASE — Whether to check for updates whenever the pe-httpd
# service restarts. To get the correct update info, the server will pass some
# basic, anonymous info to Puppet Labs’ servers. Specifically, it will transmit:
# the IP address of the client
# the type and version of the client’s OS
# the installed version of PE
# the number of nodes licensed and the number of nodes used

# disable checking after installation by editing the
# /etc/puppetlabs/installer/answers.install file.

# Upgrader Answers
# These answers are only needed if you are upgrading.

# Y or N — Used when upgrading and the amount of disk space available appears to
